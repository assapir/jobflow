# Development Standards

## Security First

Security is the most important feature. Always prioritize security in all development decisions:
- Never expose sensitive data (API keys, tokens, credentials) in code or logs
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities

## Testing Requirements

All code must be tested. Testing priority (highest to lowest):
1. **Unit Tests** (required) - Every function/component should have unit tests
2. **Integration Tests** (preferred) - Test interactions between modules
3. **E2E Tests** (consider) - For critical user flows and complex features

When adding new features or fixing bugs:
- Write unit tests at minimum
- Add integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- Consider E2E tests for user-facing features
